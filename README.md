Hello! This is the official website for the FTC-UK team Pancake Robotics!

All webpages are found in folders in main, all with the (required) file name "index.html".

All folders containing webpages should begin with Capital letters. All folders not intended to be used for webpage URLs should be fully lowercase (e.g. assets and its subfolders).

The assets folder contains all assets. Where relevant, these should be placed within organised subfolders. An exception to this is members.json and parts.csv. These should not be placed within subfolders. Another exception to this are the duplicated PancakePrint and SyrupSans .woff and .woff2 font files. These should remain in the same subfolder as the stylesheets. A copy of these fonts can be found at assets/fonts. If you move assets around, please remember to update their URLs in the relevant pages.
